# mini_builder

This mod provides support for partial restricted give command access to builders.
Give `builder` priv to someone. Then they can access `bgive <itemstring> <count>`.

Note : You can add as many as items you want in the `items.txt` from server backend
and from a server account you can execute `bgive_reload` to update the list.
Adding a item to `item.txt` and reloading doesn't require server to restarted.
